# The Story

There’s an epidemic in Trump era journalism--terrible headline writing. All one has to do is check a news app, click a link on Facebook, or even browse USA Today to see the proliferation of “slam” headlines: “Trump slams “Empire” star Jussie Smollet as third-rate actor.” Is this lazy writing, or effective strategy? Is the “slam” headline more prevalent on Monday or, say, Saturday? Does the frequency vary between publications? Is it more common in articles pushed on social media? How about on Youtube channels? 

# Data points and explanations: 

I will look specifically at headlines generated on Mondays. Although a full-scale investigation would be illuminating, this could consume the better part of a year to complete. But Monday should offer an excellent sample. 

Another important component is social media. Here, particular groups could be targeted, which adds to the already rich and potentially colorful data. 

It is pretty common to see slam headlines atop Youtube videos. So, I will also collect data to record the frequency the with which the word is used in video headlines compared to other venues.  

Is the piece a multimedia story? Does it incorporate more features than a simple blurb? 

Is it an op-ed? This is an important distinction to make given the sometimes opinionated and polarized writing on the web. 

# Methodology

As previously stated, time is a major concern, which is the primary reason I’ve limited the search to Monday’s. This will involve, going forward, a thorough review of the aforementioned sites, documenting the number of times any variation of the word slam is incorporated into a headline. Then, I will search for a link to social media and related Youtube accounts. 

There’s also a simplified version of this experiment. Over the course of a week, I can review the morning headlines each day from the mentioned sources. If necessary, time constraints might be added.
