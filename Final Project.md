# Campus Communities and how they vote 

Statistics indicate that voters without college degrees typically vote for candidates in the Republican party. But what do the numbers say about the influence of universities on their surrounding communities, and is the impact measurable? 

One might assume that college towns will cast their collective vote for democratic candidates, given the presumed influence of liberal university ideologies. Have colleges shaped the way their communities vote?

According to Pew Research Center, “higher educational attainment is increasingly associated with Democratic Party affiliation and leaning. At the same time, those without college experience – once a group that tilted more Democratic than Republican – are roughly divided in their partisan orientation.” 

A spokesperson for Pew Research said the organization could not comment on potential trends extending to 2020.  

But what impact do colleges and universities have on their surrounding communities, and looking to 2020, does the college-aged vote matter? 

David Nickerson, an associate professor and expert on voter mobilization at Temple University, said the political impact of universities on their communities is difficult to measure, given the higher socio-economic status of the temporary university residents, as well as the large influx of Ph.D. holders. 

Furthermore, it is hard to predict the impact of a transient voter base with yet to be established political affiliations. 

In the 2008 presidential election, 66 percent of voters aged 18-29 voted for Barack Obama. Although exit polls indicate the youth vote was not in fact decisive, the comparison between Obama and his opponent, Sen. John McCain was telling: college votes mattered. 

Bernie Sanders was similarly appealing on college campuses in 2015. According to The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University, Sanders carried 29 percent more of the youth vote than then candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton combined during the primary season. 

“There’s this myth that young people aren’t involved,” said Rey Junco from The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts University. “You here grumbles all the time that young people don’t vote.” 

Not since the election of George Herbert Walker Bush in 1988 has a Republican carried Illinois in a General election. Cook County, which includes Chicago, accounts in large part for the Democrats decades-long stranglehold on an otherwise politically red state.

The statistics could indeed be misleading. A predominantly red-looking state when unchecked by population data could lead one to assume an overwhelming majority of the state disagrees with Chicagoland. But what if, for a moment, Chicago was omitted from study and voter trends were measured in exclusively rural towns in southern and central illinois that are home to major universities? What do the numbers say then?  

McLean County in central Illinois narrowly elected Donald Trump its president in 2016. Despite the presence of a major universities and two community colleges, the Republican hold that momentarily gave way for Obama, held for Trump in one of the most divisive elections in recent memory. 

The county, at the modern height of youth turnout--Obama 2008-- supported the historic candidate in a historic election. But barely. With 37,689 votes, Barack Obama squeaked by McCain, by a margin of 1.20%. In Champaign County, home to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Obama defeated the Arizona Senator by over 17 points, with 48,597 votes.

This graphic reveals the narrow margin by which Barack Obama defeated his challenger, Sen. John McCain in the 2008 presidential election. The 1.20 margin is barely perceptible, perhaps presenting a slight challenge to the notion that universities could carry slightly conservative communities--at least in central Illinois. 

Of course, the size of both the counties and universities in question play a major role. The population size differential between the two counties is roughly 30,000, which is on par with the difference in university enrollment. 

But the Obama bump, at least in McLean County, moderated in 2012 when Mitt Romney appeared to earn back the votes given to the Democrat in 2008. Romney easily defeated then President Obama by nearly 7,000 votes.

The above graphic shows a precipitous decline in votes for Obama between 2008 and 2016 elections in McLean County. 

Similarly, Champaign county’s previously high turnout declined significantly.

Jackson County, near the southernmost tip of Illinois, and home to Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, shows a similar pattern in voter turnout and votes cast--Although the county is significantly smaller than both Champaign and McLean counties respectively.

The counties posses vastly different traits, but the trends are largely the same. 

But did the college-aged vote, and universities specifically, sway the respective electoral contests, and what does this all portend for 2020 and the impact of the youth vote? 

Junco argued that “young people mobilize themselves. They don’t necessarily need external motivations. Still, campaigns can’t afford to ignore young people, he said. 

The Sander’s boom on college campuses in 2015, according to Nickerson, might be explained by the position as the only other viable opposition to Clinton. This election cycle could be different.

“There are a lot more candidates who can credibly represent change,” on the Democratic side, Nickerson added. 

When comparing the Trump ticket, Nickerson emphasized the enthusiasm shown by conservative youth for Trump in 2016, and although Clinton carried a majority of the college-aged vote in 2016, young Trump voters may already be locked in on the incumbent. 

He argued that the president has done nothing while in office that could dissuade his youth voter base from casting their vote for a different candidate. 

The trends between the three studied counties are remarkably similar. Each saw a bump, however slight, with the election of Obama. But that’s where the similarities end in make-up, population, and voting.
