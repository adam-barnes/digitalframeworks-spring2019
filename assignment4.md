# Story Pitch 

Statistics indicate that voters without college degrees typically vote for candidates in the Republican party, especially if the voter is a white man. But what do the numbers say about the influence of education on communities. One might assume that college towns will cast their collective vote for democratic candidates, given the presumed influence of liberal university ideologies. Is there a measurable impact? I propose tracking voting data from several college towns. Have colleges shaped the way their communities vote? How do campaigns shape their messaging to secure a strong university presence? Or are they still considered to be largely irrelevant?

I will utilize precinct data, which should be accessible via respective Secretary of State offices. 

I could visualize the potential impact of the college vote with a trendline for each town that begins at the height of youth turnout: the 2008 presidential election. 

This is newsy given the upcoming campaign season, where there is always speculation about the college-aged turnout. 

For sources, I will reach out to the Sanders Campaign, which boasted a large turnout in the 2016 presidential primary; the Buttigeg campaign to discuss their campus strategies; Pew Research to discuss methodologies; voting experts to flesh out some of the more nuanced concepts and strategies.
