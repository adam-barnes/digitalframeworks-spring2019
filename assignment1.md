# Story Idea 1
Statistics indicate that voters without college degrees typically vote for candidates in the Republican party, especially if the voter is a white man. But what do the numbers say about the influence of education on communities. One might assume that college towns will cast their collective vote for democratic candidates, given the presumed influence of liberal university ideologies. 
Is there a measurable impact? 
I propose tracking voting data from several college towns in Illinois rural, central Illinois. Outside of Chicago, the state is decidedly Republican. Have colleges shaped the way their communities vote? 

# Story Idea 2
The measurable impact of the urban-rural divide on voter choice has been a critical pressure point for political analysts for decades. Why do cities vote predominantly for Democrats? Why are rural areas staunchly red? These questions affect how candidates reach out to particular regions. But just how localized can the data get? Sweeping generalizations serve as indicators of some voters behavior. So, I propose a hyper-localized analysis of voter data from rural counties in Illinois. Has there been a Trump effect? Can it be measured?

[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/upshot/rural-and-urban-residents-feel-disparaged-pew-survey.html]

An excellent lede reveals the point of the article, specifically the finding a a Pew Research survey, that the rural-urban divide begins and ends at one interesting observation: both sides think the other hates them. 
Rating-5

The data was shockingly simple to understand. 
Rating-5 

Overall, the data seems both accurate and adequate. Pew Research is among the recommended list of polling and survey sources any undergrad receives their first day of college. So, it is difficult to question the veracity of an esteemed source. That said, the Times author added little to Pew’s initial findings. However, even a basic recitation of the findings was effective. 
Rating-4 

Quality

The piece contained the usual indicators of a concise, well researched article from the Times, though the uninspiring graphics were at once detrimental to the reader’s experience. To be sure, the the bit of information conveyed, was communicated clearly. So in this way, the story was a success. Yet it left much to be desired from the graphics department. Rating-4 
Type and Color 
The Times graphics team provided a coherent color scheme to present a sample of the Pew Research findings. 
Rating-5 

Creativity
Other than clever phrasing, there was nothing especially creative in the story. Mundane graphics negatively impacted the piece significantly, because the story had the opportunity to be dynamic and compelling. That the finding was the product of another organizations research might have influenced the overall format and various structural elements. Taken as a informative, easy read the product was a hit. But fascinating data deserves better graphics.

Critique 2
[https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-voters-without-a-degree-remained-staunchly-republican-in-2018/]

The key finding of this study was made evident by the author in the headline: White voters without a degree remained staunchly Republican in 2018. 
Rating-5

On par with other quintessentially Five-Thirty-Eight scatter plot charts, the data was a bit jumbled. Indeed, the the site assumes general literacy, so the design choice is understandable. Still, even for a novice analyst, the choice, perhaps, obscured the story’s critical finding. Rating-3

Nate Silver’s Five-Thirty-Eight is a generally trusted source in the the analytics game. Looking back to the 2016 election, the site’s prediction, given its reasonable margin for error, was pretty accurate in predicting a close race. The authors, however relied heavily upon their own organization’s research, which could confuse a reader who is unfamiliar with the site as a credible force. 
Rating-4

Without a familiarity with particularly dense data, a reader could find the graphics frustrating. The finding itself was valuable and added to the growing literature on voter identification as it relates to race and education. Yet the graphic communicated the study’s findings, even if the plots seemed messy. At present, I don’t have any suggestions on how to improve the graphic quality of this piece. Perhaps a link to short tutorial would be useful. 
Rating-4 

The plots color scheme effectively corresponded with party affiliations, with Democratic dots in blue, and Republicans in red. 
Rating-4

Had I not been familiar with the general idea of the story’s finding, the presentation would not have drawn my attention. However, the fact that the site is not a member of mainstream media sources, the authors may have felt less inclined towards the frills, choosing instead to provide a concise article with serviceable graphics.
