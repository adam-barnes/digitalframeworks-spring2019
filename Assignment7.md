Headline: The One: Fearless professor donates to Trump campaign in 2020

One brave professor at Illinois State University risked scrutiny and social ostracism when he donated to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign in 2016. 

Business professor, Louis Reifschneider, who boasts a 2.6 rating on the prestigious academic website Rate My Professor, donated $160.00 to the president’s campaign in early October 2016. 

The university is understandably outraged. 


Pitch: According to FEC filings, one professor donated to President Trump’s 2016 campaign. Why take the chance? I plan to profile a day in the life of this trend setter and obviously loathed professor at Illinois State. 

As there was one donation listed, this was the only data source. No cleaning was necessary. 

Here are the steps I took: 
Selected Trump’s Campaign
Highlighted the City, State and Zip Code
Entered professor into the Job Description
Entered Illinois State University into the category 
Checked my results because I couldn’t believe there was only one.
