# Questions 

Q: What could account for the absence of a reporting district in incident data? 
A: Reorganization of the data did not bear out any conclusive answers this question. A possible next step would be to reach out to the Bloomington Police Department and ask what could account for this omission. Perhaps it’s just human error. 
Q2: Which day of the week sees the most disturbances? 
A: The first quarter data shows that Friday’s are the day when the disturbance complaints peak. 
Q3: Are there any dates where a noise complaint and drunkenness correspond? 
A: Recategorization of the data did not yield evidence of an overlap in the complaints. 
Q4: Is there a positive correlation between the weekend and noise or drunk disturbances?
A: Surprisingly, there is not a positive correlation between weekend days and noise or drunk disturbance reports. 

Data Cleaning Process

My first move was to expand the columns so they would be easily readable. This only needed a quick double-click between columns. 

In my initial review, I noticed missing district data. So, I reorganized the district column, where I found additional missing points. There were four disturbances with missing data. 

My next question led me to organize the data based on the number of disturbances on a given day. This was achieved by another simple data sort. Turns out that Friday was the day to be public nuisance. 

Then, I wanted to know whether there was a positive correlation between weekend days—Friday and Saturday—and the alcohol related or drunk disturbances. I created a new sheet, where I placed the disturbance type and day of the week columns. After creating the new sheet, I sorted the data and found there is not a positive correlation.

Public data from the first quarter of 2016 records an array of incidents, including noise violations, alcohol related issues, and vandalism. 

Over 1,500 complaints were filed in the first three months of 2016.
